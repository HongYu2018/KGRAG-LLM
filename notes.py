def create_graph_nodes_edges(text_content):
    prompt = f"""
    I have the following text related to a medical condition. First summerise the keywords that present the condition names, symptome names, treatment names, prevention method names, diagnosing method names and who is at rick from the conditions. Then, create graph nodes and edges to represent the relationships between key medical terms that relation maximumly include [disease names, possible cause, symptoms, treatment, diagnosing, Preventing, Who's at risk] in a structured format. The nodes should only represent important medical terms without any descriptive or verb words and key concepts, and the edges should represent the relationships between them.

    Ensure the output is a validate JSON file that can easily be read and transfoer to the following Python code format:
    nodes = []
    edges = []
    nodes.append(Node(id="Term1", label="Description1", size=25, shape="circularImage"))
    nodes.append(Node(id="Term2", label="Description2", size=25, shape="circularImage"))
    edges.append(Edge(source="Term1", label="relation", target="Term2"))

    Text:
    {text_content}

    Provide the nodes and edges in a JSON formate that must be validated JSON file. Remember no further comments or explanations are needed to add to the file only the pure JSON data no '''json are needed.
